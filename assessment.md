**Participation** in lectures and office hours as well as asking, discussing, and answering questions on the [discussion forum](discussion-forum.md). One good way to get participation going is to to **ask at least one question per lecture**. Here are some reasons why I think that this is a good idea:

  - I often feel uncomfortable when asking questions. But asking good questions is one of the most important skills. It is good to use every opportunity to practice.
  - Thinking about questions is the best way to start revising the material.
  - Most importantly, every question you ask is feedback that allows me to make the course more relevant to you.

**Homework:** Most lectures will finish with some homework. Homework is not graded. Come to my office hourse to discuss any questions. Homework is essential to achieve the learning outcomes.
