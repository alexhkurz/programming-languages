## Course Description 

**The aim of the course** is to have a look under the hood of programming languages. How do programming languages work? Could you design your own programming language? Instead of looking at particular examples of programming languages, we will build our own. It will be a small language and the implementation will not be efficient, but we will be able to understand in all detail how it works. 

Next semester, in Compiler Construction, we will demonstrate that the principles we learn this semester also apply to industrial scale programming languages such as C++. 

**Prerequisites:** (MATH 250, CPSC 350) I assume that you know at least one, ideally a few more, programming languages. It would also be good to have learned something about computer architecture. One theme of the course is how to bridge the gap between a programming language and the actual machine, so some awareness of how actual machines work is needed to fully appreciate the material. Finally, while I will introduce the mathematics that we need to engineer our programming languages, some ability in manipulating formal mathematical models as typically acquired in a discrete mathematics or introductory logic course will be needed.

You must score a 70 or above to receive a P when taking the course P/NP.

## Late Policy
If you need more time for an assignment 
- convince me that you already have done substantial work (for example by showing me the code in your GitHub repository);
- explain the special circumstances that would allow me to justify giving you more time.

## Participation

- It is expected that students attend every lecture and participate in the [Discussion Forum](discussion-forum.md). 
- I also appreciate if students make use of the office hours, which gives me valuable feedback on how the class is going.
