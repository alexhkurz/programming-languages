## Assessment

Assessment will be divided in a total of 200 points.

- 3 programming [assignments](assginments.md) each worth 20 points (60 points total)

- A [blog](blog.md) worth 50 points.

- Participation worth 10 points.

- A midterm worth 20 points.

- A final exam worth 60 points.

**Participation** in lectures and office hours as well as asking, discussing, and answering questions on the [discussion forum](discussion-forum.md). One good way to get participation going is to **ask at least one question per lecture**. Here are some reasons why I think that this is a good idea:

  - Asking good questions is one of the most important skills. It is good to use every opportunity to practice.
  - Thinking about questions is the best way to start revising the material.
  - Moreover, every question you ask me is feedback that helps me to make the course more relevant to you.

The 10 participation points will be divided up as follows.

- One point for an interesting question or answer on the discussion forum, up to 5 points max. 
- 5 points for discussing what you have written in your blogs in my office hours. I will not chase you, it is your responsibility to arrange a meeting. And do this early enough before the deadline so that you can use the feedback for improvements (aim at Week 7 or 8). 

**Homework:** Most lectures will finish with some homework. Homework is not graded. Come to my office hourse to discuss any questions. Homework is essential to achieve the learning outcomes.
