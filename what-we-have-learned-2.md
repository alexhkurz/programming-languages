## What we have learned in Part 2

We have learned that one can capture meaning by quotienting by an equivalence relation.

We have used this idea to explain the difference between operational and denotational semantics.

Denotational semantics maps syntax into a mathematical domain that we already understand from studying its mathematical properties. 

Operational semantics, by contrast, associates rewrite rules for each syntactic construction. 

Adequacy is the property that operational and denotational semantics coincide.

We have seen examples in which adequacy can be understood logically as soundness and completeness of a logic wrt its semantics.

## Further exercises

If you want to check whether you understand these concepts, extend what we have done to a larger language including

- variables,
- subtractions,
- division.

I wrote up a [guided tour with exercises](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ByNBNEITP) of how to add variables. 

## Coming up next ...

In the next part, we will learn how to extend the calculator to a functional programming language. We will see that all we have to add are variables, a mechanism to define functions and then to apply functions to arguments.
