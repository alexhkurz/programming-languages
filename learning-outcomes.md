## Course Learning Outcomes

See also the [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).


After completing this course, students will be able to

- explain how an interpreter for simple functional and imperative programming languages work
- use a context-free grammar and a parser generator such as BNFC 
- add simple features of their own to the languages and interpreters
- explain syntax and semantics of various simple calculi and programming languages
- understand lambda-calculus as a foundation of programming languages
- explain various features of programming languages based on the computational model of term-rewriting
- define and prove basic properties of term-rewriting systems
- understand the significance of abstract and algebraic data types and their relationship to universal algebra
- explain the basic principles of program verification
- use well-founded orders in termination proofs of simple programs
- use invariants in partial correctness proof of simple programs
- write Haskell programs that use recursion over algebraic data types

Moreover, students will be able to acquire the basic ideas of advanced topics such as theorem proving, dependent types and mathematics as a specification and programming language.

Finally, students will learn to appreciate that mathematics is not only important for developers who create the tools used in everyday engineering practice, but also that the knowledge of the mathematical concepts and results underpinning these engineering tools impact everyday engineering practice (and increase your chances to pass a coding interview). I discuss some aspects of this in a these notes on [mathematics as a programming language](https://hackmd.io/s/ByGLTvFDE).
